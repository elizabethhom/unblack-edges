# unblack-edges
When making copies with a copy machine, it's very common for them to have dark, black lines along the edges due to misalignment in copying. Given a pbm image, *unblack-edges* removes these black edges from the image by mimicking the popping and pushing properties of a computer's call stack.

### Compile & Run
* Compile program using "make"
* Run with executable ./unblackedges \<PBM Image\>
